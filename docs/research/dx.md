# Eta DX research — conclusions

Curated, durable conclusions of the DX-PRD-0001 programme
(`.scratch/research/dx-prd-0001.md`). This document exists so that a year
from now anyone can answer "why is the API shaped like this?" without living
memory. Protocol records (predictions, gates, ratings, decisions) live in
`.scratch/research/dx-journal.md`; per-experiment evidence lives on the
`research/dx-e*` branches.

Guiding star: *`Effect` is `Result` with concurrency and spans — `map`/
`map_error` on values, `bind`/`bind_error` on sequences, `fold` on both
channels.* Every conclusion here is judged by whether it moved Eta toward
that sentence.

**Status:** programme started 2026-07-18. One experiment promoted.

## E23 — Error channel mirrors `Result` (promoted 2026-07-18)

The handle cluster now mirrors `Stdlib.Result`: `bind_error` (was `catch`),
`fold ~ok ~error` (replaces `recover` and `or_else_succeed`), and
`to_result` / `to_option` / `to_exit` (were the bare nouns `result` /
`option` / `exit`). `catch_some` and `or_else` kept. Handle cluster: 11 vals
→ 10, 10 concepts → 8.

Why, in one sentence: OCaml already owns this mental model — `Result` has
`map`/`map_error` and `bind`/`bind_error` — so the whole error channel
became teachable as "`Effect` is `Result` with concurrency and spans".

Evidence: blind review (fresh-context reviewer, OCaml-native persona) rated
the new naming 4,4,4 against 3,3,1 for the old, and produced the old API's
invited bug on demand ("`catch` strongly suggests `try ... with`"). The
`to_*` prefix was validated from names alone. Red-team probe: `bind_error`
cannot swallow exceptions — defects surface as `Cause.Die`.

Accepted tradeoff: pure recovery-only sites are noisier (`fold ~ok:Fun.id`
where `recover f` used to do) — flagged by both the executor and the blind
reviewer. Accepted deliberately: one both-channel fold beats two extra
near-duplicate combinators. If usage data shows the pattern is hot, revisit
with evidence (follow-up F2 in the journal).
